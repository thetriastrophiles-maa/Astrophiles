                <p>The threat of asteroid impacts, though rare for civilization-ending events, remains a significant concern for planetary scientists and space agencies. Earth has been hit by countless asteroids throughout its history, with evidence ranging from ancient craters to observations of smaller objects burning up in the atmosphere.</p>
                <p>In recent decades, significant efforts have been made to identify, track, and characterize Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) – asteroids and comets whose orbits bring them close to our planet. Telescopic surveys, such as NASA's Planetary Defense Coordination Office (PDCO) initiatives, continuously scan the skies for potential threats.</p>
                <p>Beyond detection, the concept of planetary defense involves developing strategies to mitigate impact risks. One prominent method is kinetic impact, demonstrated by missions like NASA's Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART). DART successfully altered the orbit of a small asteroid by crashing a spacecraft into it, proving the viability of this technique.</p>
                <p>Other concepts include gravity tractor missions, where a spacecraft's gravitational pull gently nudges an asteroid over time, and even more speculative ideas involving lasers or nuclear devices for larger, more immediate threats. International collaboration is key, with agencies worldwide sharing data and coordinating efforts to protect our home planet.</p>
                <p>While the immediate threat is low, continued investment in planetary defense research and technology ensures that humanity is prepared for whatever the cosmos may send our way. Understanding these celestial mechanics is not just about avoiding disaster, but also about advancing our knowledge of the solar system's formation and evolution.</p>

                    <div class="article-full">
                        <p>The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revolutionized our understanding of the early universe, peering back through time to witness the birth of the first galaxies. Since its launch, this remarkable observatory has exceeded all expectations, delivering breathtaking images and groundbreaking scientific discoveries that are rewriting astronomy textbooks.</p>

                        <h3>A New Window to the Cosmos</h3>
                        <p>Positioned approximately 1.5 million kilometers from Earth at the second Lagrange point (L2), JWST operates primarily in the infrared spectrum. This capability allows it to detect light from objects so distant that their visible light has been stretched into infrared wavelengths due to the expansion of the universe—a phenomenon known as redshift.</p>

                        <p>The telescope's massive 6.5-meter primary mirror, composed of 18 gold-coated beryllium segments, collects light with unprecedented sensitivity. This engineering marvel, combined with its suite of advanced instruments, enables JWST to observe galaxies that formed just a few hundred million years after the Big Bang.</p>

                        <div class="highlight-box">
                            <strong>Did You Know?</strong> JWST can detect heat signatures equivalent to a bumblebee at the distance of the Moon. This incredible sensitivity allows astronomers to study the faintest and most distant objects in the universe.
                        </div>

                        <h3>Discovering Ancient Galaxies</h3>
                        <p>One of JWST's most significant achievements has been the identification of galaxies that existed when the universe was less than 5% of its current age. These ancient structures appear more massive and mature than theoretical models predicted, challenging our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution.</p>

                        <p>The telescope has revealed that early galaxies were extraordinarily diverse, exhibiting a wide range of shapes, sizes, and star formation rates. Some of these primordial galaxies are surprisingly compact and dense, while others are already showing signs of the spiral and elliptical structures we observe in the local universe today.</p>

                        <h3>Implications for Cosmology</h3>
                        <p>These discoveries are forcing astronomers to reconsider long-held theories about how galaxies form and grow. The presence of such massive galaxies so early in cosmic history suggests that galaxy assembly was a far more rapid and efficient process than previously thought.</p>

                        <p>Moreover, JWST's observations are providing crucial insights into the epoch of reionization—a pivotal period when the first stars and galaxies ionized the neutral hydrogen that pervaded the early universe. Understanding this transformation is essential to comprehending how the universe evolved from its simple, uniform state after the Big Bang to the complex cosmic web of galaxies we see today.</p>

                        <h3>Looking Forward</h3>
                        <p>As JWST continues its mission, we can anticipate even more remarkable discoveries. The telescope is already scheduled to observe potential planets around distant stars, analyze the atmospheres of exoplanets for signs of habitability, and probe deeper into the cosmic past than ever before.</p>

                        <p>The data flowing from JWST is not just expanding our knowledge—it's inspiring a new generation of astronomers and reminding us of the profound questions that drive scientific exploration: Where do we come from? How did the universe begin? And are we alone?</p>

                        <div class="highlight-box">
                            <strong>What's Next?</strong> Scientists are planning observations that will search for the very first stars—massive, metal-free objects that existed before any galaxies formed. These Population III stars have never been directly observed, but JWST may finally reveal them.
